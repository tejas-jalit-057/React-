# React Learning Repository

This repository contains my step-by-step learning and practice projects while studying **React.js**.
Each folder represents a specific React concept or mini-project, arranged in a logical learning order.

The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in React by practicing concepts individually
and then applying them in small projects.
